**Ethereum Smart Contract Development with Solidity**

Start your journey into the world of Ethereum Smart Contract Development

This book covers the fundamentals of smart contract development on Ethereum and any other EVM network, using Solidity and the Foundry framework. You will learn how to create smart contracts for your own business logic, how to write automated tests to validate the correct behavior of your contracts, as well as how to create web applications as frontends for your decentralized applications.

In addition to this general knowledge, this book teaches you how to create your own fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFT), following the ERC20 and ERC721 token standards to ensure compatibility with software wallets such as Metamask and marketplaces like OpenSea.

This book is written for experienced developers who are familiar with either one of the following programming languages: C++, C#, Java, or JavaScript. In addition, the reader should have a fundamental understanding of decentralized networks. After reading this book, you will be able to start your own decentralized projects that have the potential to reach millions of users.
